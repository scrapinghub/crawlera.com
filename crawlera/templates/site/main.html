    <h3>About</h3>
    Crawlera is a smart HTTP/HTTPS proxy designed specifically for scraping purposes. Although it provides a standard HTTP proxy interface it does a lot more internally, like throttling access to domains by introducing delays and discarding IPs from the pool when they get banned or have other problems. As a scraping user, you no longer have to worry about tinkering with download delays, concurrent requests, user agents, cookies or referrers to avoid getting banned from sites, you just configure the proxy and fire up your crawler of choice and start scraping.
