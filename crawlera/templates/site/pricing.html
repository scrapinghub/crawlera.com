  <h3>Pricing</h3>
  <p>Unlike other proxy providers, Crawlera offers a simple pricing
  model, where you only pay for successful requests. This means that
  you will not be charged if there is no capacity for processing your
  request from a clean slave. You also have the option to reserve
  additional slave proxies to use exclusively for your requests (thus
  preventing other customer requests interfering with yours) or even
  supply your own proxies to the pool of slaves.
