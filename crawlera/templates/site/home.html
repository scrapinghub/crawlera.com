    <p>Crawlera is a smart HTTP/HTTPS proxy designed specifically for
  scraping purposes. Although it provides a standard HTTP proxy
  interface it does a lot more internally, like throttling access to
  domains by introducing delays and discarding IPs from the pool when
  they get banned or have other problems. As a scraping user, you no
  longer have to worry about tinkering with download delays,
  concurrent requests, user agents, cookies or referrers to avoid
  getting banned from sites, you just configure the proxy and fire up
  your crawler of choice and start scraping.
